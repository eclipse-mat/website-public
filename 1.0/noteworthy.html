		significant changes made to the Memory Analyzer for the 1.0 release.
	</p>

	
		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Acquire Heap Dumps from within MAT</h2>
			
			<p>
				It is possible now to acquire a heap dump from a locally running JVM directly
				from Memory Analyzer. The triggered heap dump is then parsed and opened in
				the tool.
			</p>

			<p>
				This functionality is achieved using heap dump provider extensions. 
				Currently there is one heap dump provider which can trigger HPROF heap dumps
				with the help of 'jmap' (part of Sun based JDKs), and several heap dump providers
				for IBM JVMs.
			</p>

			<p>

			</p>

			<p>
			<img src="mimes/acquire.png" alt="The &#34;Acquire Dialog&#34; provides the possibility to select the Java process to be dumped, as well as to configure some parameters needed to execute this operation."/>
			</p>

			

		</div>

		
		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">More Flexible Compare Functionality</h2>
			
			<p>
				It is now possible to compare not only the global class histograms of two different
				heap dumps, but an arbitrary number of table-formatted results - for example the 
				retained sets of three different objects. It doesn't matter if the tables which 
				are compared come from one and the same or different heap dumps.
			</p>

			<div class="p">
				
				This means that one has now the possibility to do things like:
				<ul>
				<li>Compare the retained set of a specific package across several heap dumps</li>

				<li>Compare how the retained sets for application objects A1, A2 and A3 (all in the 
				same heap dump) differ from each other</li>

				</ul>
 
			</div>

			<p>				
				Here is a quick description how to compare several retained set tables.
			</p>

				
			<p>
				<strong>1. Move all tables to be compared to the Compare Basket</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				All queries which are executed in Memory Analyzer can be seen in the Navigation History View.
				From this view one can add the results to be compared to the Compare Basket. 
				The Navigation History is still per heap dump, therefore if one wants to compare 
				tables from different heap dumps then they have to be added one by one.
				Multiple tables from one heap dump can be added at a time. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<img src="mimes/nn_add_to_compare_basket.png" alt="Move from Navigation History to Compare Basket"/>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>2. Modify the order of the tables</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Using the tool bar of the Compare Basket one can modify the order in which talbes 
				should be compared, i.e. select which result should be the baseline, which comes second, etc...
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="mimes/nn_compare_basket.png" alt="Modify the Tables Order in the Compare Basket"/>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>3. Execute the comparison</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the preferred order is achieved just click the execute button...
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="mimes/nn_click_compare.png" alt="Click Compare"/>
			</p>

			<p>
				... and see the result.
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="mimes/nn_compared_tables_absolute.png" alt="Modify the Tables Order in the Compare Basket"/>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>4. Customize the displayed result</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				By default the absolute values of all tables will be shown for every compared property,
				e.g. number of objects, shallow size, etc... One can now change between deltas and
				absolute values, as well as select which columns should be compared:
			</p>

				<img src="mimes/nn_select_columns.png" alt="Select Columns To Be Compared"/>				
			</p>

			</p>
			
		</div>

		
		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Grouping by Superclass</h2>
			
			<p>
				Now it is also possible to group objects by superclass in a histogram. 
				This provides an easy way to find for example all the subclasses of java.util.AbstractMap, etc...
			</p>

			<p>
				<img src="mimes/nn_group_by_superclass.png" alt="Group a Histogram by Supserclass"/>
			</p>

		</div>

		
		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">"Search Queries..." in the Context Menu</h2>
			
			<p>
				The query browser ("Search Queries...") is now also available in the context menu.
				It offers only queries valid for the current selection, and is easier to use as it can display
				some or all the queries, and shows also the help for each query.
			</p>

			</p>

			</p>
			
		</div>

		
		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">API Reference</h2>
			
			<p>
				To make things easier for people interested in extending Memory Analyzer or writing MAT queries
				for their specific purposes, a new section "API Reference" was added to the Help
				topics of Memory Analyzer. It contains Javadoc as well as descriptions for 
				the different extension points which MAT provides.
			</p>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">New &amp; Noteworthy for Memory Analyzer 0.8</h2>
			
			<p>
				The New &amp; Noteworthy document for version 0.8 is available 
				<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/0.8/noteworthy.html">here</a>.
