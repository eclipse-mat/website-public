			<p class="p">Memory Analyzer can now display correct object sizes for HPROF heapdumps from Java processes 
			running on x64 with the option -XX:+UseCompressedOops. The option -XX:+UseCompressedOops
			specifies that the object pointers used by the VM are compressed in order to reduce memory consumption.
			The HPROF heap dump file does not provide the information if the option was used or not, and 
			until now Memory Analyzer always displayed the uncompressed size.
			The new version does some additional analysis of the object addresses to recognize if 
			the object pointers are compressed, and show the correct object sizes also for such heap dumps.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
			One can check if the tool assumes compressed pointers or not in the "Heap Dump Details" view.
